# MVC Pattern

The Nutrition Assistant backend follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. This pattern separates the application into different layers to make development and maintenance easier.

## Model Layer

The Model layer is responsible for managing data and communicating with the MongoDB database. It defines schemas for different collections such as User, Food, Meal, and Diet Plan using Mongoose.

## View Layer

In this project, the View layer is represented by the API routes. These routes receive HTTP requests from the frontend and direct them to the appropriate controller functions.

## Controller Layer

The Controller layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes user requests, interacts with models, performs calculations, and sends responses back to the client.

## Advantages of MVC

* Improves code organization.
* Makes maintenance easier.
* Supports project scalability.
* Allows multiple developers to work independently.
* Simplifies testing and debugging.
